# Intellij IDEA: Importing a Gradle project

<div id="importing-gradle-project">

<box type="tip" seamless>

If the project comes with Gradle support, you will see a `build.gradle` file in your project root.
</box>

<box type="warning" seamless>

IntelliJ IDEA has the Gradle plugin installed by default.  If you have disabled it, go to `File` → `Settings` → `Plugins` to re-enable it.<br>
  If your project involves GUI programming, similarly ensure the JavaFX plugin has not been disabled.
</box>

1. Open Intellij.
1. If you are in the welcome screen, Click `Open`. Otherwise, click `File` -> `Open`.<br>
   i. Select the project directory, and click `OK`.<br>
   ii. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults but do ensure that the selected version of `Gradle JVM` matches the JDK being used for the project.
1. Confirm the correct Java version is being used for Gradle, as follows:

<div class="indented-level1" id="configure-intellij-sdk">

   (a) Confirm the project JDK is set to the one you are supposed to use for the project, as explained [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).<br>
   (b) Confirm the correct JVM is used for Gradle, as given in the panel below:

<div class="indented-level1">
<panel header="Intellij: Setting the JVM for Gradle" peek>

Go to `File` -> `Settings` and ensure the `Gradle JVM` is set as `Project SDK ...`, so that Gradle will use the same JDK used by the project.

Also take note of the `Build and run using:` and `Run tests using:` settings. They are useful if you want to control whether you want Intellij to use Gradle to build/run/test your project.

4. After the importing of the project is complete (which could take a few minutes), you will see the `Gradle Toolbar` in the IDEA interface %%e.g., look for the elephant icon (on Windows, this appears on the right-edge of the IDE window) and click it%%.<br>
